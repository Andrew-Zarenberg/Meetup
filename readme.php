				<strong>Starting</strong><br />
				The first time the user views the application, they will be shown the <a href="#tab2">Index Page</a> which contains a brief description about Meetup and provides a link to Register Page.  After registering an account the user will be automatically logged in and redirected back to the index page.<br /><br />
				Next, the user may browse groups and events through the <a href="#tabListOfGroups">List of Groups</a> and <a href="#tabListOfEvents">List of Events</a> pages.  The user may also use the search bar.<br /><br />
				Upon viewing a group the user would like to join, the user may click the Join Group button.  Alternatively, if the user sees an event they would like to go to, they can click a link to join the group and RSVP to the event simultaneously.
